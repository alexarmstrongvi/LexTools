# LexTools
Collection of generally useful code

- **python/LexTools** - general python tools

I use to have bash and C++ tools but those were removed for now.

# Python
## Python tools
I am not interested in making this package installable right now so add the `python/` directory to PYTHONPATH or run
```
source ~/LexTools/python/add_to_python_path.sh
```
Then you can import LexTools like any other package
```
import LexTools
```

## Testing
**Python**
To run unit tests on python tools, run `pytest` inside `python/`.
This requires installing pytest package.

**Bash**
Use `shunit`
